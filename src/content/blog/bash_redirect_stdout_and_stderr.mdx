**The solution for this is noted below**

## bash redirect stdout and stderr to the same file

### Solution

```shell
# Basic syntax:
command &> output_and_error_file

# Note, in Bash and other Linux shells, when a program is executed, it
#	uses one of three standard I/O streams. Each stream is represented
#	by a numeric file descriptor:
#		- 0, or stdin, the standard input stream
#		- 1, or stdout, the standard output stream
#		- 2, or stderr, the standard error stream
#	By default the ">" operator uses 1 and is equivalent to "1>"

# Example uses:
# Redirect the standard error to a specific file:
command 2> error_file

# Redirect the standard output and standard error to different files:
command 1> output_file 2> error_file
```
