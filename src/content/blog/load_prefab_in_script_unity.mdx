**The solution for this is noted below**

## load prefab in script unity

### Solution

```csharp
/*
To use Resources.Load,
the object must be in a Resources folder.(there can be multiple).
So your folder structure could look like "Assets/Resources/Prefabs/prefabName"
Then to load it use*/
Resources.Load("Prefabs/prefabName") as GameObject;
```
