**The solution for this is noted below**

## flutter singleton

### Solution

```dart
class Singleton {
  static final Singleton _instance = Singleton._internal();

  factory Singleton() => _instance;

  Singleton._internal();
}

// Whenever you need to get the singleton, call its factory constructor, e.g.:
//   var singleton = Singleton();
//
// You'll always get the same instance.
```
