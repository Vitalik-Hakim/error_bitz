**The solution for this is noted below**

## >>> import numpy Illegal instruction (core dumped)

### Solution

```python
Confirmed. Just for the record, this solution (overriding environment variable) allows numpy to be loaded despite the wrong CPU detection:

>>> import os
>>> os.environ["OPENBLAS_CORETYPE"] = "nehalem"
>>> import numpy as np
>>>
```
