**The solution for this is noted below**

## Scripts may close only the windows that were opened by them.

### Solution

```javascript
// You can only close a window that your script made, so this is possible:

window.open('', '_blank', '')
window.close()

// But otherwise you can change the link, like that:

location.href = 'https://bruh.io'

// Make sure that you have https://
```
