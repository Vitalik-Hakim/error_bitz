**The solution for this is noted below**

## combine path python

### Solution

```python
# Python program to explain os.path.join() method
   
# importing os module
import os
 
# Path
path = "/home"
 
# Join various path components
print(os.path.join(path, "User/Desktop", "file.txt"))
 
 
# Path
path = "User/Documents"
 
# Join various path components
print(os.path.join(path, "/home", "file.txt"))
 
# In above example '/home'
# represents an absolute path
# so all previous components i.e User / Documents
# are thrown away and joining continues
# from the absolute path component i.e / home.
 
 
# Path
path = "/User"
 
# Join various path components
print(os.path.join(path, "Downloads", "file.txt", "/home"))
 
# In above example '/User' and '/home'
# both represents an absolute path
# but '/home' is the last value
# so all previous components before '/home'
# will be discarded and joining will
# continue from '/home'
 
# Path
path = "/home"
 
# Join various path components
print(os.path.join(path, "User/Public/", "Documents", ""))
 
# In above example the last
# path component is empty
# so a directory separator ('/')
# will be put at the end
# along with the concatenated value
```
