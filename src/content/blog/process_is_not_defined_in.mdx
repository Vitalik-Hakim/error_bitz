**The solution for this is noted below**

## process is not defined in react vite

### Solution

```javascript
If you are using Vite, use import.meta.env instead, process.env is removed.
And make sure variables start with VITE_ in .env file.
//in .env 
VITE_GITHUB_URL= 'https://api.github.com'
//in App.jsx calling environment variable
console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_GITHUB_URL)
//never use sensentive data in .env as vite or create react app  include in build
//instead create server.

process is a global object in Node.js that provides information about,
and control over, the current Node.js process. It is not available in the browser.

If you are using Vite, a web development build tool, you will not have access 
to the process object because Vite is designed to run in the browser and does
not have access to the Node.js runtime.
