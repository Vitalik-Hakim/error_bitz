**The solution for this is noted below**

## interactive rebase in progress

### Solution

```shell
Step 1: Keep going git rebase --continue

Step 2: fix CONFLICTS then git add .

Back to step 1, now if it says no changes .. then run git rebase --skip and go back to step 1

If you just want to quit rebase run git rebase --abort

Once all changes are done run git commit -m "rebase complete" and you are done.
```
