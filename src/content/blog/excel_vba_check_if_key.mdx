**The solution for this is noted below**

## excel vba check if key is in collection

### Solution

```vb
'A Dictionary is a better choice when you need to determine if a key
'is already in the collection. But here is a VBA function that
'reports True or False for Collections:

Function KeyExists(key$, c As Collection)
  On Error Resume Next
  c.Item key
  KeyExists = Err = 0: Err.Clear
End Function

'--------------------------------------------------------------------

MsgBox KeyExists("Netflix", colFANG)
