## how to pass an array value to a pthread in c

### Solution

```c
void* my_Func(void *received_arr_Val){

	int single_val = (int *)received_arr_Val;
    printf("Value: %d\n", single_val);
	//Now use single_val as you wish
}
//In main:
	int values[n];
    pthread_create(&thread, NULL, my_Func, values[i]);
	//i is the index number of the array value you want to send
	//n is the total number of indexes you want (array size)
