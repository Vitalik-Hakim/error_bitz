**The solution for this is noted below**

## grep powershell

### Solution

```shell
To grep in powershell use Select-String. Select-String uses regex wildcards
so you have to use .* instead of only * (for instance). You can also specify
path.

ls | Select-String -Pattern ".*Anders.*"

ls | Select-String -Path ".*Code.*" -Pattern ".*\.cs"
```
