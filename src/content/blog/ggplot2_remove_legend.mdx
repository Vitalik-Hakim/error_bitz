**The solution for this is noted below**

## ggplot2 remove legend

### Solution

```whatever
### Three options (where p is the plot object)

# Remove the legend title:
p + theme(legend. title = element_blank())

# Hide the entire legend to create a ggplot with no legend.
p + theme(legend. position = "none")

# Hide legend for a specific geometry, say geom_text().
p + geom_text(show.legend = FALSE)
```
