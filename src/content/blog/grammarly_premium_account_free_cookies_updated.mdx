What is Grammarly premium Account?
Grammarly is quite relevant for checking typos and improving grammar. However, in my opinion, this application can do something more than that. It’s particularly helpful to me, who often writes reports.

Who needs Grammarly Premium Account?
Well, I have to say that everyone who writes in English requires it. This application is mainly intended for students or people who work in the academic world and write in English.

This application is also beneficial for those who work in the creative sector (such office employees having the task of communicating with foreigners), requiring publicity in English. It is very helpful.

Grammarly Premium can translate and write English documents?
Nope, it is not Google Translate, nor is it script-writer. Grammarly works to fix the writing I have created beforehand and analyze if my writing is according to written English rules.

So, can Grammarly Premium Account automatically improve English skills?
Not directly, but through this application, I learned a lot of things about what is and isn’t allowed and what is not as precise and more precise, in addition to a variety of grammar variations. In my opinion, this Grammarly may be used in the beginner level up to the expert level.

Perhaps only fundamental grammar will be corrected for the beginner level, assuming that the person has a real understanding of writing English sentences.

Unlike Grammarly at no cost, which only provides fundamental grammar and spelling check features, Grammarly premium may perform more than that.

At least nine features can be enjoyed to correct text that is entered into the application. When the free feature provides an archive correction limit of 500 words, the Grammarly premium Account version can mend entire documents simultaneously in * doc format.

Spelling
Make a typo check.
Grammar
Grammar correction and sentence structure such as interest inside, I could spend six months (therefore ), and so on.
Punctuation
Remove unnecessary punctuation or include punctuation, which should exist.
Fluency
Provide equivalent words that are more suited to this context of the sentence, such as replacing”complete words” together with”whole,” “entire,” or”complete.”
Conventions
Perform dialect checks, such as erasing comma mistakes without spaces, adjusting capital letters, etc..
Formality
This depends on the writing style that you would like to carry, whether formal, semi-formal, and informal. For example, writing”couple weeks,” that should be”a few weeks.”
Conciseness
This is a feature that determines if the sentence from the text is concise rather than redundant.
Clarity
Serves to facilitate others’ comprehension of the writing. In other words, the writing reads more clearly.
Vocabulary
One vital feature for people who still lack a broad language in writing. Some examples: changing the word”very afraid” to be”terrified,” “very cute,” to be”cute,” “essentially” to be”primarily,” and”important” to be”crucial” or”notable.
How to use Free Grammarly Premium Account Cookie?
No special skills are needed to utilize Grammarly Premium Account because all it takes is uploading the document that you want to correct in the computer drive. Automatically, Grammarly will scan uploaded files, check them, and supply advice on what things require attention to or should be fixed.

Before scanning, Grammarly will bring a pop-up window containing questions about the author’s aims or objectives. It matters whether the writing is either descriptive or exploratory, formal or informal, and educational, casual, or technical. Grammarly will adjust the structure and vocabulary to match the aim.

Grammarly displays the value or standing of our writing through the correction procedure on a scale of 0–100. The higher value means the corrected writing has mistakes and is near the goal of writing set from the start. After all, documents are corrected and get a value of 100, Grammarly can also display a record of writing in the kind of picture info.

This graphic information presents general information concerning the number of words, unique words (diversity of words in the whole writing), uncommon words (steps the thickness of words that are rarely used from 5,000 common English words), average sentence length, and readability score.

The readability score is chosen from the Flesch reading- facilitate – test, which aims to measure how others read a written record. The higher the score is, the easier it is to see, but it’s more enlightening for postgraduate-level pupil writing. Articles meant for academics or people with minimal university education levels urge grades ranging from 35- to 50.

One more interesting feature is the feature to do whether the uploaded text contains an element of plagiarism. This feature is quite important, particularly for an academic writing style. It helps to ensure that the writing delivered is free of plagiarism components, such as copy-paste, which can be strictly prohibited in writing.

Grammarly once again scans the text with millions of texts from Google’s database. After the scanning process is complete, the application shows the percentage of this text’s portion to the database. An acceptable plagiarism demonstration might be less than 5%. When it”s greater than this, then you should get ready to paraphrase the written sentence.

Grammarly Premium Account is not with no minuses. After using it for a while, I’ve concluded that this application has some shortcomings or incompatibilities.

The Clarity feature always indicates corrections for passive voice; it’s recommended that it be converted into an energetic voice. In the type of study writing I do, I mainly use passive sentences to change its focus.

Instead of writing, “I used a qualitative approach for the analysis,” I write, “A qualitative approach was employed” The first sentence focuses on me as a researcher. In contrast, the second sentence concentrates on the method or instrument used.

Grammarly Premium Account doesn’t necessarily enhance my writing abilities. In order to use Grammarly optimally, it’s best to examine why Grammarly corrects a record as it will, instance, for example. If it isn’t used in this manner, the user will not benefit from the corrected document. This is important so that in the future, users are more sensitive to their writing style and apply the suggestions provided before.

The plagiarism feature in the application only checks through the writing database on the pages of the site. I’m still doubtful whether the plagiarism feature may be used to test scientific papers published in journals.

Additionally, sometimes I must look at the parts suggested as plagiarism; they’ve turned out to be just portions of writing, which are general, such as; “to tackle this issue,” “it is important to note,” etc.

Overall, I recommend Grammarly Premium Account to anyone learning how to write well and correctly, including myself. Grammarly premium Account subscription is $139.95 / year, but I got a 46% coupon yesterday, so I only needed to spend $75.

Worth it or not? Yes, I think it’s very worth it, considering that I have recently had many college assignments. Though grammar is not the essence of writing, the subject discussed, there’s nothing wrong about learning how to improve your writing to make it even more readable. Furthermore, it’s just a process, so the thickness of discussion and good grammar may go together.

Grammarly vs a Human Proofreader
There are numerous instances of AIs replacing human resources.

Resources as Grammarly have turned out to be a genuine risk to professions as editing and proofreading. Many people think they do not have to work with a pro any longer as Grammarly can get it done.

Effectively, in this particular section, we are going to try to assess it with simple examples.

Grammarist.com is an internet resource for English grammar that has explored just how excellent Grammarly proofreading is and whether it can change hand proofreading.

They opened a premium account and set many sentences from an article pretty much published online with several rewordings. As they report, the device was asked to have a look at forty-three slips.

If the outcome came, they found out it’s been in a position to identify thirty-one out of them, making seventy-two %.

Ben Kepes is a famous Forbes contributor that agrees to it as well as provides some basic examples. So long as a writer has mistyped’ of’ as’ fo’ in a sentence, the equipment can’t identify it occasionally.

He gives the device fails to identify a few obvious errors in both spellings as well as grammar.

He suggests, though the device performs very well to assess writing abilities, it doesn’t stand as a single solution; neither could it exchange hand proofreading.

As for ideas such as rephrasing a sentence as Grammarly will choose, the suggested sentences are often uncomfortable.

For example, if you create a sentence as “It’s the village which Elena lives in, ” the effect will ask one to replace’ Its’ with It’s or’ It is.’

Second, it will ask one to use the word’ in’ between the village and which.

Therefore, as per the device, the appropriate sentence will be, “It’s the village where Elena lives.”

Which seems quite awkward! Possibly, the app can’t think critically as a human brain regarding the clauses mentioned above.

We can tell that no, the equipment can’t replace man proofreading. Nevertheless, it could aid proofreaders in doing many fundamental things.

Grammarly+human editing is going to be an excellent mixture, maybe.
