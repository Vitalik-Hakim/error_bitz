**The solution for this is noted below**

## python split dict into chunks

### Solution

```python
# Since the dictionary is so big, it would be better to keep
# all the items involved to be just iterators and generators, like this

from itertools import islice

def chunks(data, SIZE=10000):
    it = iter(data)
    for i in range(0, len(data), SIZE):
        yield {k:data[k] for k in islice(it, SIZE)}

# Sample run:
for item in chunks({i:i for i in range(10)}, 3):
    print item

# Output
# {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 2}
# {3: 3, 4: 4, 5: 5}
# {8: 8, 6: 6, 7: 7}
# {9: 9}
```
