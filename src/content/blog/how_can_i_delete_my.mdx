## how can i delete my profile picture on twitter

### Solution

```whatever
There is no way to remove your profile picture from Twitter. That is, you can't delete the image and go back to the default avatar. Previously, you could click or tap on the picture, select Remove, and the image would disappear.
```

**Try other methods by searching on the site. That is if this doesn't work**
