**The solution for this is noted below**

## c++ run a loop for a certain time

### Solution

```cpp
#include <ctime>
//ctime library to use clock() function
int intial_time =clock();
//initialization of the time as clock() returns the time of the program until its line in miliseconds
    while(clock()<intial_time+(//the time u want in miliseconds)){
       	//the loop u want until the time u want ends
    }
//as total the program will just keep checking if he has finished the time u want or not
```
