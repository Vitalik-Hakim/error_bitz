**The solution for this is noted below**

## perl exit loop

### Solution

```perl
# Basic syntax:
last;
# Where last is analogous to break in Python, Bash, R, etc

# Example usage:
for my $i (0 .. 5) {
	print "index is $i\n";
    # Exit the for loop if the index equals 3
	if ($i == 3) {
		last;
    }
}
```
