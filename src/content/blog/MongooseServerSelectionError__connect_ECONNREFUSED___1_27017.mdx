**The solution for this is noted below**

## MongooseServerSelectionError: connect ECONNREFUSED ::1:27017

### Solution

```javascript
If you are using latest nodejs -v > v17,
 then try updating mongodb url from localhost to 127.0.0.1 This worked for me

 const MONGODB_URL = "mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017";
 /or
 const MONGODB_URL = "mongodb://0.0.0.0:27017"
```
