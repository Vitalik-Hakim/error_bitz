**The solution for this is noted below**

## unity movetowards

### Solution

```csharp
float speed;
Vector3 goalPosition;

void Update()
{
	transform.position = Vector3.MoveTowards(transform.position, goalPosition, speed * Time.deltaTime); //goes from the position of the gameObject to the goalPosition in a strait line with a speed of "speed"
  	//Also works with Vector2
}
```
