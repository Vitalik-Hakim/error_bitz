**The solution for this is noted below**

## Git change remote branch name

### Solution

```shell
1. Verify the local branch has the correct name:
git branch -a

2. Next, delete the branch with the old name on the remote repository:
git push origin ––delete old-name

3. Finally, push the branch with the correct name, and reset the upstream branch:
git push origin –u new-name

Alternatively, you can overwrite the remote branch with a single command:
git push origin :old-name new-name
Resetting the upstream branch is still required:
git push origin –u new-name
```
