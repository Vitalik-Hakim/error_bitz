**The solution for this is noted below**

## rror response from daemon: manifest for jenkins:latest not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown

### Solution

```whatever
The jenkins image has been deprecated for over 2 years in favor of the
jenkins/jenkins:lts image provided and maintained by the
Jenkins Community as part of the project's release process.

Use below image:
docker pull jenkins/jenkins
docker run -p 8080:8080 --name=jenkins-master -d jenkins/jenkins
```
