**The solution for this is noted below**

## django model save method override manytomanyfield

### Solution

```python
django does not get the m2mfield in save() method.
instead use signal(m2m_changed)

from django.db.models.signals import m2m_changed

class Topping(models.Model):
    # ...
    pass

class Pizza(models.Model):
    # ...
    toppings = models.ManyToManyField(Topping)

def toppings_changed(sender, **kwargs):
    # Do something
    pass

m2m_changed.connect(toppings_changed, sender=Pizza.toppings.through)
```
