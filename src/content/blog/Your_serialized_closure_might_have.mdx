**The solution for this is noted below**

## Your serialized closure might have been modified or it`s unsafe to be unserialized.

### Solution

```php
php artisan cache:clear
php artisan config:clear
php artisan key:generate

If the above doesnt work then look for a backup .env file and use the same APP_KEY to resolve it.
```
