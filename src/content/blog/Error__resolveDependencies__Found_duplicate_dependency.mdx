## Error: resolveDependencies: Found duplicate dependency key `undefined`

### Solution

```javascript
I have experienced this problem yesterday,
none of the solutions mentioned in this
(https://github.com/facebook/metro/issues/857) metro Github
repository issue have not worked for me. After hours of debugging,
I changed my `"metro-config": "^0.73.2"` version,
to `"metro-config": "0.71.3"` in `package.json`
file and it have worked! :)
```
