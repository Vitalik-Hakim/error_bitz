**The solution for this is noted below**

## Ensure Prettier is installed and defined in your environment PATH variable. You can optionally specify a custom path in `JsPrettier.sublime-settings` using the `prettier_cli_path` setting.

### Solution

```shell
#In your terminal run the following:
	which node
	which prettier

# if which prettier result empty then
# npm (global):
    npm install --global prettier

#Copy the result of the output for each step and in
#SublimeText3 proceed to:
#Preferences --> PackageSettings --> JsPrettier --> Settings-User
#In the user settings build your file as such:

{
    "prettier_cli_path": "output from terminal here",
    "node_path": "output from terminal here",
    "auto_format_on_save": true,
}
```
