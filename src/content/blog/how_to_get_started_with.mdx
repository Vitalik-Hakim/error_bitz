## how to get started with python

### Solution

```python
#the best way to start with anything is not to rush and start with the basics
#python however is really good for begginers as it is easy to read and understaned
#and has relatively easy syntax so dont spend a lot of time on the basics like
#print() and if  rather learn the basics and learn about the libraries
#and a good way to learn about the libraries is https://pypi.org/ if you are also
#struggling to find motivation for programming the best way to work around it is
#to learn how dopamine works in your brain and how to use it in progoramming
#for that use the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QiE-M1LrZk
#for a good IDE i reccomend pycharm
#and remember programming is not something you should remember to be good
#programming is something you need to understand and to be a good programmer you
# need to know how to put the internet to a good use and to know where to search

#if this helped leave it an upvote
