## how to trigger events when the document loads in js

### Solution

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', ready)
function ready() {
	alert('DOM is ready')

	// image is not yet loaded (unless it was cached), so the size is 0x0
	alert(`Image size: ${img.offsetWidth}x${img.offsetHeight}`)
}
```
