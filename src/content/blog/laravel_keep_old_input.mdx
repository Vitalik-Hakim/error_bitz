**The solution for this is noted below**

## laravel keep old input

### Solution

```php
You can access the last inputs like so:

$username = Request::old('username');

<input type="text" ... value="{{ old('username') }}" ... >.

As described in the docs it is more convenient in a blade view.

Check: https://laravel.com/docs/5.3/requests#old-input
```
