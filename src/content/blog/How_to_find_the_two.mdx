## How to find the two parts of a vector 2 C++

### Solution

```typescript
// Our Vector2
Vector2 vec{1, 2};

// The first element of the vector
randomFunctionA(vec.x);

// and the second element of the vector
randomFunctionB(vec.y);

// The same goes for a vector3 but you use a z for the third element
```
