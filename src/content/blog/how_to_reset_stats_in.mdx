## how to reset stats in diablo 2

### Solution

```typescript
Talk to Akara
To reach this character, fans simply need to complete the first quest in Act 1, and a "reset stat/skill points" option will appear upon interacting with her. This is not an option that players can use endlessly, though, as Akara will only offer one reset per difficulty level.
```
