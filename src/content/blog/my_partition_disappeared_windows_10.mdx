**The solution for this is noted below**

## my partition disappeared windows 10

### Solution

```shell
# if the partition missing could be for loss of drive letter do the
# steps below to assign a letter to the missing partition and
# the drive will be back without any issue or data loss.

# Type the steps one by one in command prompt and hit enter
# You shouldn't type the lines that begin with #
--------------
# oepn diskpart
diskpart
--------------
# list the partitions on the selected disk
list volume

# now this part is important. Now DISKPART is showing you a list of all
# volumes on your computer. look at the "Ltr" column and see if all of the
# volumes have a letter( like E,F,G,...). if there is a volume that doesn't
# have a letter (if the Ltr cell is empty) that volume might be the parition
# that has disappeared from your computer so we'll assign a letter to it.
--------------
# lets say for example volume 0 doesn't have a letter. first we select it:
select volume 0
--------------
# and finally assign the letter you want to it
assign letter=D
--------------
# Done, now exit.
exit
--------------
# Now look in your file explorer to see if the disapeared partition is back
```
