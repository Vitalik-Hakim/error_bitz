**The solution for this is noted below**

## aws ec2 connect does not work with ubuntu 18.04

### Solution

```shell
# On Ubuntu this is not enabled by default (but, it works out-of-the-box
# on Amazon Linux 2). Usually to enable this, installing
# ec2-instance-connect should be enough:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install ec2-instance-connect
```
