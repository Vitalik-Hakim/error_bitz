## how to check is object by this type c#

### Solution

```csharp
class Animal { }
class Dog : Animal { }

void PrintTypes(Animal a) {
    Console.WriteLine(a.GetType() == typeof(Animal)); // false
    Console.WriteLine(a is Animal);                   // true
    Console.WriteLine(a.GetType() == typeof(Dog));    // true
    Console.WriteLine(a is Dog);                      // true

PrintTypes(spot);
//Summary GetType more strict in contrast with "is", that even with parents OK too
