**The solution for this is noted below**

## error: requires babel "^7.0.0-0", but was loaded with "6.26.3". if you are sure you have a compatible version of @babel/core, it is likely that something in your build process is loading the wrong version. inspect the stack trace of this error to look for

### Solution

```javascript
'This error message is related to a version mismatch between Babel and the required version specified in your project's dependencies.
'Babel is a JavaScript transpiler that allows you to use next-generation JavaScript syntax in older browsers. It seems that your project requires Babel version 7.0.0-0, but the installed version is 6.26.3.
'To resolve this issue, you can try updating Babel to the required version. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

npm install babel@^7.0.0-0

'If you're using yarn, the equivalent command would be:
yarn add babel@^7.0.0-0
```
