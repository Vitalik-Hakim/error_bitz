## UE4 Log

### Solution

```cpp
UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT("Some message") );
UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT("The integer value is: %d"), YourInteger);
UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT("The float value is: %f"), YourFloat);
UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT("The vector value is: %s"), *YourVector.ToString());
//Multiple
UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT("Current values are: vector %s, float %f, and integer %d"), *YourVector.ToString(), YourFloat, YourInteger);

replace Warning by on of these:
