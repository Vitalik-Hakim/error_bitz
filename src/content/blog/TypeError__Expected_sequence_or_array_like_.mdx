**The solution for this is noted below**

## TypeError: Expected sequence or array-like, got class `sklearn.tree._classes.DecisionTreeClassifier`

### Solution

```python
#It depends on your case but for me it was this
#   WRONG CODE IS BELOW
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
acc = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
# you dont test the accuracy of the model directly what you need to do is this:
# RIGHT CODE
model = DecisionTreeClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
acc = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(acc)
# you can see that I made a prediction and then measured the (next line =)
# accuracy of this prediction
