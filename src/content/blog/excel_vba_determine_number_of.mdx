**The solution for this is noted below**

## excel vba determine number of elements in a 1D array

### Solution

```vb
'Since VBA arrays can have any integer value for the base element,
'the only sure fire way to determine how many elements is in the array
'is to calculate the value:

MsgBox UBound(Arr) - LBound(Arr) + 1		'<--for elems in 1D array

MsgBox UBound(Arr, 1) - LBound(Arr, 1) + 1	'<--for rows in 2D array
MsgBox UBound(Arr, 2) - LBound(Arr, 2) + 1	'<--for cols in 2D array
```
