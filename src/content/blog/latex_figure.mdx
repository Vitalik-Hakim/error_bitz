**The solution for this is noted below**

## latex figure

### Solution

```whatever
\usepackage{graphicx}
% inside document:

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=1]{path/name_of_file_inside_directory}
	\caption{Your caption}
	\label{label_that_can_be_referenced_later}
\end{figure}

% use float option [H] after {figure} to place figure exactly as positioned
	in LeTeX code
% preferably place file of image inside directory of tex file so
	no pathway required
```
