## Iterating through key names from a PSCustomObject Powershell

### Solution

```shell
$ipinfo = Invoke-WebRequest 'http://ipinfo.io/json' -UseBasicParsing | ConvertFrom-Json
foreach ($info in $ipinfo.PSObject.Properties) {
    $info.Name
    $info.Value
    '--' # <-- Seeing this double hash proves we're iterating fully.
}
```
