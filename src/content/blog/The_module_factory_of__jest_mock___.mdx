**The solution for this is noted below**

## The module factory of `jest.mock()` is not allowed to reference any out-of-scope variables.

### Solution

```whatever
I just stumbled upon this while googling and it seems like I've missed this crucial line in the error message along with everyone else:

If it is ensured that the mock is required lazily, variable names prefixed with mock are permitted.

Just change the name of what you're mocking to mockYourComponentName
```
