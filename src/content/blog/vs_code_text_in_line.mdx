**The solution for this is noted below**

## vs code text in line

### Solution

```cpp
The setting you're trying to modify is "word wrap".
Just go to File > Preferences > Settings, search "Word Wrap" and
it will appear. There are several options, but I think that the
one that achieves the behaviour you want is just setting it to "on".
```

**Try other methods by searching on the site. That is if this doesn't work**
